    " - **Due date: February 20th, 2020**\n",
    " - **Assignment:** Undergraduate students may work in groups of up to three students (it is up to you to find partners); graduate students should submit individual solutions. \n",
    " - **Guidelines:** discussions are encouraged; identical solutions are still considered academic dishonesty.\n",
    " - **Submission:** Remove *all* superfluous instructions, make sure that all relevant code, output and comments are present and print the page to a pdf (preferably using the Download as PDF route; alternatively, use your browser's print to PDF function). PDF's should be submitted on GradeScope and are graded out of 100 points; each day a submission is late (midnight cutoff) will result in a deduction of 15 points.\n",
    "   - Parts 1-3 need to be solved using Python/Cantera, unless stated otherwise. All code and documentation should be provided.\n",
    " - **Don't forget to add your name(s)!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** When starting, save this notebook under a new file name to prevent data loss (use `File > Make a Copy ...` in the Menu bar)."
