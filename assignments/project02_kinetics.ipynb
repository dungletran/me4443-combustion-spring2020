    " - **Due date: ~March 31st~ April 5th, 2020**\n",
    " - **Assignment:** Undergraduate students may work in pairs (it is up to you to find a partner); graduate students should submit individual solutions. \n",
    " - **Guidelines:** discussion among groups is permissible; identical solutions are nevertheless considered academic dishonesty.\n",
    " - **Submission:** single pdf document containing:\n",
    "    - Write-up: type-set solution (Undergraduate students: maximum of 7 pages total; graduate students: maximum of 10 pages total), including all text, equations, figures, tables, etc.; section headings should follow problems; provide appropriate figure and/or table captions.\n",
    "    - Code listing: needs to be complete and does not count towards page maxima."

    "Provide all equations needed to solve for the equilibrium concentration for the water-gas shift reaction $\\mathrm{CO_2} + \\mathrm{H_2} \\leftrightarrow \\mathrm{CO} + \\mathrm{H_2O}$ using Gibb's free energy at a given temperature and pressure. **Graduate students:** outline a step-by-step algorithm that would allow you to solve the equations (you may assume knowledge of equilibrium constants and/or reaction rates for the _global_ reaction step).\n",

    "The jupyter notebook [06_thermo_gibbs](../examples/06_thermo_gibbs.ipynb) illustrates Gibbs free energy for product/reactant mixtures at a given temperature and pressure. In addition, the notebook also provides a results for the case where additional species are considered (equilibrium: the water-gas shift reaction is _not_ an elementary reaction; instead, it reproduces the effect of multiple elementary reactions).\n",

Compare results to results of 1.a/b, _document your findings_ and _interpret results_. Specifically, propose a mechanism (i.e. the fewest possible set of reactions) that result in the global reaction equation given in 1.a. **Graduate students:** comment on species/reactions where quasi-steady-state (QSS) and/or partial equilibrium approximations would apply, and provide a rationale.\n",

Comparing notes from lecture, identify the most relevant reactions involved in the reactions (note: there are _two_ different mechanisms at play). Illustrate how temperature affects NOx formation; _document your findings_ and _interpret results_ using appropriate means (i.e. figures, tables and/or diagrams). **Graduate students:** comment on whether and/or how the amount of $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ available in reactants affects $\\mathrm{NOx}$ concentrations.\n",

Compare the overall fuel breakdown for a **fuel of your choice (other than methane; should be part of GRI3.0)**; identify the most relevant reactions, and reference your findings to textbook(s) and/or lecture notes. **Graduate Students:** The code uses a reactor object where simulations can be stopped at any given temperature. Describe how this simulation differs from simulations used in ~2.c~ 1.c and ~3.a.~ 2.a Comment on how fuel breakdown changes as fuel is depleted and temperature increases; _document your findings_ and _interpret results_ using appropriate means."

Note that this [online resource](https://github.com/Cantera/cantera-jupyter/blob/master/reactors/batch_reactor_ignition_delay_NTC.ipynb) does contain useful information, although it uses a constant volume reactor.
